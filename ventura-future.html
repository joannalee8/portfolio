			<h2>The Project + Dan Friedman</h2>
			<p>The premise of the project was to create graphic assets as well as digital assets for Ventura Future, a cultural organization based in Milan, Italy. Before starting, we took inspiration from the radical modernist, Dan Friedman, to start the project. As junior designers, we felt the importance of studying figures from the past that shaped the design world as we know it today.</p>

			<h2>Study of Dan Friedman</h2>
			<p>From our study of Dan Friedman's works, we pulled four qualities that we believed were present in all of his works.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use of combination grids</li>
				<li>Energy created through scale and orientation</li>
				<li>Reversible figure ground motifs</li>
				<li>Varying use of typographic alignment</li>
			</ol>

			</div>

			<h2>Dan Friedman + Graphic Assets</h2>
			<p>Continuing our study of Dan Friedman, the team decided on creating reversible figure ground by using scaled up type. The general rule of thumb was to fill in the enclosed spaces with colours that represented the four theme of the 2019 Ventura Future exhibition: food, academies, craftsmanship, and technology. Spaces that were not fully enclosed were filled with information that was vital for visitors to know to attend the exhibition.</p>

				<div class= "vf-totebag"><img src= "img/ventura-future/totebag.png" alt= "ventura future tote bag"></div>
			</div>

			<h2>Microsite: Ideation</h2>
			<p>The team researched more into Ventura Future to see what the most appropriate use of a microsite would be. As determined, Ventura Future fully relies on designer applications for the exhibition to run, as there would be no design exhibition with no applicants. The benefits of becoming an exhibitor is the exposure, the networking opportunities, and global recognition. </p>
			<p>With the benefits taken into consideration, the microsite proposes to promote the 2020 Ventura Future exhibition to increase the number of applicants by highlighting the benefits prospective exhibitors may receive using past statistics from the 2019 exhibition.</p>

			<h2>Microsite Interactions</h2>
			<p>The microsite utilizes an infinite scroll and the user will only be required to scroll through the contents. Only at the end, is there an option to click a button to access the application page. The user loads into the microsite and is met with a black screen that decodes into numbers that were significant to the 2019 Ventura Future exhibition.</p>

			<img src= "img/ventura-future/vf-loading.gif" alt= "gif of decoding numbers">

			<p>The numbers from the top to bottom represent: number of visits, square metre of space that the exhibition is held in, number of academies participating, number of exhibitors, and the year 2020. The numbers are then presented on the side and follow through with the user down the page and acts as a sticky progress bar.</p>

				<div><img src="img/ventura-future/progress-bar1.gif" alt= "progress bar for ventura future site 2"></div>
			</div>

			<h2>Dan Friedman Qualities in the Microsite</h2>
			<p>The difference of interaction design and graphic design shifted the project in terms of using Dan Friedman qualities. The scaled up type to create figure ground wasn't used in the microsite. Instead, the microsite uses a white bar in the progress bar to create figure ground. Also, various us of typographic alignment wasn't possible as it would affect the legibilty of the site, therefore was rejected. The same went for the use of combination grids.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>As junior designers, it is important to study precedent designers who shaped the industry as we know it today. Studying Dan Friedman allowed the team to understand what Friedman meant by referring to himself as a radical modernist. The use of Swiss typography in a non-conventional way set Dan Friedman apart from other designers. Transferring Dan Friedman's graphic design qualities into interaction design was also an important step as the team learned that not all graphic design elements translated well into interaction design elements. It is crucial to have a solid foundation in graphic design to do well in interaction design. Thus, concluding that graphic design skills are vital to create a great UI design.</p>
