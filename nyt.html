				<p>The New York Times has been focusing on their digital subscription count and have set a business goal of hitting 15 million digital subscribers by 2027. Although the growth in subscribers is in the upward trajectory for New York Times, the growth of their subscribers is on a decline and the main reason for this growth was proven to be a result of <em>heavily discounted offers to entice readers to subscribe.</em> Further studies also brought forth the insight of the <em>New York Times being the most cancelled digital newspaper subscription</em> as the perceived lack of time for reading did not match the regular rate they had to pay after the promotion rate ended. </p>

				<h2>Nieman Lab Survey</h2>
				<p>By combing through a survey conducted by Nieman Lab, which gathered insights from 503 respondents, the team derived another key insight on why subscribers were unsubscribing from the New York Times: <em>respondents were cancelling because of information overload as they did not make the time to read news.</em></p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project really started off with understanding the business problem that the New York Times was facing and providing a design solution. I believe I was able to exercise my prior business education to understand the problem space and utilize my skills as a designer to empathesize with the users to propose this solution.</p>

				<p>As the decision maker for the sprint, there were moments where I took extra days to research clients and to call out moments when the project was falling short. We started with a client that was in an interesting space but no concrete business motivations which I had to make the difficult call to switch clients. That said, I also put in the extra hours during the days the team set out to take a break to make sure that I was bringing options to the team instead of just announcing we had to pivot. During this process, I combed through surveys that had 500 respondents that pointed towards New York Times having an evident business problem to solve and then pitched the new client to my team. I would like to thank the team for trusting in my process and gut feeling with the pivot.</p>
