				<p>With pandemic hitting the world in the beginning of 2020, many sought out for a new hobby that they can do safely within their own home. In combination, with the rising popularity of infamous "Harry Styles" cardigan created by JW Anderson that took the storm, many also sought out to create their own version at home– with the fraction of the price. Wool and the Gang, a fashion DIY company, saw a 69% increase to its site following these trends but their users were left unsupported after receiving their knit kits.</p>

				<h2>Brand Value Pillars</h2>
				<p>To back up considerations and decisions for the project, the following brand values were derived to ensure that the company's values and interests were reflected in proposed solutions:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Knitwork Knowledge: engaging in platforms that encourage creative education.</li>
					<li>Slow Fashion: a product made by you with minimal environmental impact.</li>
					<li>Make it Fashionable: shift existing social conventions of knitting; it’s not just for Grandma’s, it’s for everyone.</li>
					<li>Gang Related Activity: connecting like-minded makers with a passion for hand-crafted knitwear.</li>

					<p>Untangled by WATG works as a supplementary mobile application that is to be used with the written patterns that come with the knit kits. The application will fill in the need of a teaching and troubleshooting assistant, as well as an inspiration platform where knitters can look for future pieces to knit up and instantly buy as a knit kit from the Wool and the Gang e-commerce platform.</p>

					<h2>Art Direction</h2>
					<p>Colour was not considered as the team agreed that the platform should play as a blank canvas for the colourful knit pieces to be the star of the show. However, despite not using colour, the project played around with the scale and boldness of Helvetica Extended to bring forth the bold and unapologetic nature of the knitwear future.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As an avid knitter myself, this project was an eye opener as there were intricacies of knitting that I forgot about during the learning phase. It was also interesting to witness the sheer amount of interest that this hobby has garnered over the years and I'm glad I was able to propose a solution that can allow for more prospective knitters to join the community.</p>

				<p>This project also gave the team an opportunity to really understand the strengths of each other and to utilize it to its full potential. As with academic projects, it may seem to divide all aspects of the project equally, but through this project, the team learned that it only made sense to allow the strength carriers of each aspect to focus on their strengths. Thus, the project was able to conclude successfully.</p>
